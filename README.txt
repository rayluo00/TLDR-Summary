TLDR Program
Last Modified on August 2016

Program used JSoup (version 1.10.1), a Java string parser library to retrieve the article from
and website provided. Program will take the input data, parse the string by splitting it into
sentences and formulate a summary of the whole article by compressing relevant information.
The TLDR program will be able to differentiate between actual sentences and titles (e.g., Mr.,
Ms., Mrs., Dr., PhD., etc...). It will calculate the words that are relevant and added to an
ArrayList to find relevant words for sentence combinations.
