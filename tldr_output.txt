While it has been said for a long time that the U.S. is bleeding manufacturing jobs
overseas, particularly to China, some businesses have been moving operations the
other way round.GMAnd now, the head of a leading Chinese glass maker making the
same move has openly questioned if his country really is such a lucrative
destination for offshore factories, reports Hong Kong newspaper the South China
Morning Post.Overall speaking, the tax burden for manufacturers in China is 35%
higher than in the U.S., Cao Dewang told China Business Networkin an interview. He
added that a combination of cheap land, reasonable energy prices and other
incentives means that, despite higher manufacturing costs, he can still make more
money by making glass in the U.S. than by exporting Chinese-made panes to the U.S.
market.His company, Fuyao Glass, has invested over $1 billion stateside, according
to the Post, the most significant move of which is opening its U.S. factory in the
Ohio town of Moraine, a suburb of Dayton, back in October. The glass maker is
re-purposing the town's former General Motors assembly that had been standing empty
since late 2008, as the Dayton Daily News reports.According to Ohio TV station
WDTN, the plant now employs a workforce of almost 2,000, and Cao expects that the
fully operational facility will employ up to 3,000 workers.Wage and transportation
costs are getting higher in China, Cao says. Compared with four years ago, labor
wages [in China] today have tripled, he told China Business Network. Meanwhile,
transportation in the U.S. costs the equivalent of less than one yuan ($) per
kilometer, while road tolls [in China] are higher, he added, pointing out that some
mid- and small-sized Chinese enterprises have already started moving to Southeast
Asian countries like Vietnam and Cambodia for cheaper wages and materials.Fuyao is
not the first Chinese business making the move across the Pacific in recent years.
According to the Wall Street Journal, Chinese companies invested over $20 billion
in the U.S. last year -from a practically nonexistent total investment back in
2006.And yet, it would probably be mistaken to write off the world's second largest
economy as a manufacturing powerhouse once and for all. As FortuneÂ reported in
early December, the latest data indicates that China's manufacturing sector is in
its strongest position in some years, buttressing the country's economic growth
along the way.
